# Web-Cam-Marker-Tracker
Tracks up to 2 checker markers in a webcam.  
Based on DirectShow.Net. Tracking written from scratch. (Does not use OpenCV)  
Below shows a simple cap that works well with this software. The cap keeps the orientation of the markers as the markers can rotate.  
The longer you make the rod's the better resolution. (Basically try to make the markers reach the edge of the camera view when rotating your head)  
You can also up the capture resolution in the webCapture control.

Here are the trackers to print out. Make sure the black is as black as you can get it and the white is as white as you can get.
